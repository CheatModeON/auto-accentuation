# auto-accentuation
For people that are bored to use the keyboard's key for accentuation before using accentuation (in greek layout), use this script.

# How to use
run it with python with administration rights

````sudo python main.py ````

Then use the following shortcuts for greek language:

αα   + space = ά

εε   + space = έ

ηη   + space = ή

ιι   + space = ί

ιιι  + space = ϊ

ιιιι + space = ΐ

οο   + space = ό

ωω   + space = ώ

υυ   + space = ύ

uuu  + space = ϋ

υυυυ + space = ΰ
